# Fraction - part A
Class named Fraction that represents a fraction of two integers. Overload the following operators for this class:

## Arithmetics operators
* The  operator + - adds two fractions and return their sum as another fraction in reduced form.
* The  operator -   subtracts two fractions and return their difference as another fraction in reduced form.
* The  operator *   multiplys two fractions and return their product as another fraction in reduced form.
* The  operator /   divides two fractions and return their quotient as another fraction in reduced form.

## Compare operators
* The  operator == compares two fractions for equality and return true or false.
* All comparison operations (>,<,>=,<=)

## Countup and countdownd operator
* The operators ++ & --  adds (or substracts) 1 to the fraction. implement both pre and post fix.

## C>>out and S<<in operators
* The  operator <<  prints a fraction to an output stream in the format “numerator/denominator”.
* The  operator >> to read a fraction from an input stream by taking two integers as input.
